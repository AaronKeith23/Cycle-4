# Cycle-4

Description: For this project, I have worked on an PHP Project, Community Forum. Among its functionality, users are able to create student accounts and which will then show on the page of available students that want to be included in playing basketball.

Dependencies: This project depends on data tables created in phpmyadmin, and the ccuresearch server.

Usage: This project can be used for communities who want to engage groups of people by recieving their information to then be asked to inform them on when and who wants to play basketball within a community in this case students.

Future Work: For future work, I would incase the scability of the website. Adding features such as creating rosters/schedules for small rec leagues once the websites data became populated enough with players.

Major and Project Relation: I am an Information Systems major with a minor in Intelligence. One field that employees in this field work in is webpage development and functionality.
